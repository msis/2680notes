# Working on PABLO boxes from `vscode`
The [Remote SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) plugin can be used to access the PABLO boxes from `vscode` through [[ssh]].

Once installed, an icon "Remote Explorer" will show up on the sidebar.
From there, add a new **SSH Target**.
Provide the [[ssh]] command you used to access the box from the terminal (`ssh -l student2680@192.168.4.24` for example).
A tree of the remote home directory will show up and you can which folder you want to work on. 

!!! note
	You can use the terminal inside `vscode` from now on.
